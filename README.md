Presented by [Nesrine](https://github.com/nesrinehanane) and [Abdeldjalil](https://github.com/Fcmam5). The talk was started by a moment of silence for uncle ** Houari ** (رحمه الله) , Then we thank the [AUF or Oran university1](http://www.univ-oran1.dz/index.php?option=com_content&view=category&id=72&Itemid=553) and Miss ** Asmaa Bengueddach ** .
Then we spoke about our club, then why we chose computer science as field of study.

The talk contained some jokes, and funny *gif* that people liked.
